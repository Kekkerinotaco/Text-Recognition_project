# Text-Recognition_project
Here is a mini app i build around and open source Tesseract NN, for me and my coworkers to use to search for specific words in scanned docs.

Installation:
1) You need to download and install the Tessetact NN on your pc, and place the installation in folder named "LocalTesseract" (check the LocalTesseractExample.png);
2) In the 02.PyInstallerCommand folder you have a command to run, to have a complete programm installation;
3) After installing, place the LocalTesseract folder to the dist folder, and then you are ready to go!
